Sometimes we keep looking for resources everywhere only to realize that we had
it with us the whole time. Situation like these might arise when you have too
many choices. I too faced these moments before. It is a tough situation indeed.

I think one should develop art of learning before trying to learn a lot of
things at once. Once you know how to learn and improve how to learn through
constant iterations. It becomes easy thereafter.

I changed quite a lot as a developer and person. Last year. I was all about
learning new technologies, getting super aware about all the frameworks that
are popular. Now, I don't even bother checking these. My goals are now mostly
on low level decisions or high level architecture. All these frameworks and
likes are just tooling. Nothing less nothing more. The main focus should be on


# Using a string here means the worker will not have to
# pickle the object when using Windows.
app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings')
app.autodiscover_tasks(lambda: settings.INSTALLED_APPS)
{% endhighlight %}
